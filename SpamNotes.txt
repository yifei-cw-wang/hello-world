Naive Bayes Classifiers

Naive Bayes is a machine learning method you can use to predict the likelihhod that an event will occur given evidence that's present in your data

Types:
* Multnomial: when features are continuous
* Bernoulli: binary features
* Gaussian: normally ditributed features

Assumptions:
* predictors are independent
* a priori assumption: this is an assumption that the past conditions still hold true.When we make predctions from historical values, we will get incorrect results if present circumstances have changed

Ensemble Learning

* Using multiple learning algriothms together for the same task to better predict
* Feature and Lables -> decision tree, supportive vertor machine , logistic regression algorithm -> combine three models
* e.g. decision tree -> predict yes
support vertor machine -> predict yes  VOTING--> yes
logistic regression -> predict no
